# PyKarstNSim

A Python interface for the [KarstNSim](https://github.com/ring-team/KarstNSim_Public) C++ library, enabling graph-based and geologically-driven simulation of 3D karst networks directly from Python. This wrapper was developed by the [SISKA (Swiss Institute for Speleology and Karst Studies)](https://www.isska.ch) 

## About

PyKarstNSim provides Python bindings to KarstNSim, a powerful tool for simulating realistic karst network geometries. This package is based on the  [KarstNSim_Public](https://github.com/ring-team/KarstNSim_Public) repository developed by the RING team.

### Credits

KarstNSim was originally developed by:

- **Augustin Gouy** (PhD development, 2022-2025)
- **Benoît Thébault** (initial implementation, 2022)
- Supervised by **Pauline Collon** and **Vincent Bailly-Comte**

The methodology adapts the karst synthesis approach from:
